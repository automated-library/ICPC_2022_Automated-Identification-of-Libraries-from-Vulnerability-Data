# XML-CNN
Implementation of [Deep Learning for Extreme Multi-label Text Classification](http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/yiming/Publications/jliu-sigir17.pdf) using PyTorch.

> Liu, J., Chang, W.-C., Wu, Y. and Yang, Y.: Deep learning fo extreme multi-label text classification, in Proc. of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 115-124 (2017).

# Requirements
- Python: 3.6.10 or higher
- PyTorch: 1.6.0 or higher
- torchtext: 0.6.0 or higher
- Optuna: 2.0.0 or higher

You can create a virtual environment of Anaconda from `requirements.yml`.  
We can't guarantee the operation of Anaconda environment other than the one created with `requirements.yml`.

```
$ conda env create -f requirements.yml
```


# Datasets
The dataset must be in the same format as it attached to this program.

It contains one document per line.  
It's stored in the order of ID, label, and text, separated by TAB from the left side.

```
{id}<TAB>{labels}<TAB>{texts}
```

You can get the tokenized RCV1 dataset from [Lewis et al](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lewis04a.pdf). by using this program's bundled `data/get_rcv1.py`.  
__Caution: This dataset is tokenized differently than the one used by Liu et al.__  
__Caution: If you want to use this dataset, please read the terms of use (Legal Issues) of the distribution destination.__

# Dynamic Max Pooling
This program implements Dynamic Max Pooling based on the method by [Liu et al](http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/yiming/Publications/jliu-sigir17.pdf).

The p shown in that paper becomes the `d_max_pool_p` in `./params.yml`.  
As in the paper, `d_max_pool_p` must be a divisible number for the output vector after convolution.


# Evaluation Metrics
Precision@K and F1-Score are available for this program.  
You can change it from `./params.yml`.

# How to run
## When running at first
### Donwload RCV1

Donwload datasets from http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lyrl2004_rcv1v2_README.htm.  
__Caution: This dataset is tokenized differently than the one used by Liu et al.__  
__Caution: If you want to use this dataset, please read the terms of use (Legal Issues) of the distribution destination.__

```
$ cd data
$ python get_rcv1.py
```


### Make valid dataset

```
$ python make_valid.py train_org.txt
```


### Make dataset for Params Search

```

```

## Normal Training

```
$ python train.py
```

## Params Search
```
$ python train.py --params_search
```
or
